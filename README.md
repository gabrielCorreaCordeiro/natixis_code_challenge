\- We have 2 projects here, a frontend and a backend.

\- to run the backend, you need edit some things in the application properties:

&nbsp;	- the datasource url: spring.datasource.url

&nbsp;	- the datasource name and password: spring.datasource.username/password



\- After this, you will can start the project normally and execute **script.sql** directly on your database to assign the key generator on user\_system table.



\- in this project you can test using the following Swagger URL: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html





\- To run the frontend, you need first install the following packages:

&nbsp;	- *npm install react-router-dom axios-mock-adapter react-icons*

\- After you can execute using: *npm start*

\- the default URL is: http://localhost:3000



\- the mocked user is: 

&nbsp;	- Username: adm

&nbsp;	- Password: 123
